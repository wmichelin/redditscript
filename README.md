REDDIT TRENDS
============

A python script to communicate and interact with reddit.com
This script scans the comments of reddit.com, filtering out comomonly used words as well as words longer than normal. It adds these words to a list. If a duplicate word is encountered, the program counts this and adds the duplicate object to a seperate list. 
After all of this, the program will tweet the most trending words to @reddittrends
